          Hello. My name is Allen Hendricks. I am a software engineer with 10
          professional working years of software development experience. I pride
          myself on my abilities to communicate well with others, be a
          respectful mentor, an attentive student, and a friendly easy going guy
          to work with. Oh, and I am a pretty good software developer as well!
          With the amount of time I have spent in the field, I have been party
          to an extensive amount of different programming languages, agile
          methodologies, management styles, consulting work, fully remote teams,
          databases, various authentication layers, sever architectures, you
          name it. Finally and most important to me is that I never stop
          growing; I am always trying to improve and hone my skills further.
